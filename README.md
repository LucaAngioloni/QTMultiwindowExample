# QTMultiwindowExample
A multiwindow example using signals and slots.

So let's say you have a MainWindow class that controls the main Window view. Than you want to create a second window controlled by Website class.

You then want to connect the to classes so that when you click a button on the Website window something happens in the MainWindow.

I made a simple example.

The keypoints are the connections between signals and slots and the management of windows pointers or references.
